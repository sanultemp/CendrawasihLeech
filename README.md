### .netrc
.netrc used by aria or ytdl for downloading private file with login required. so... you can fill your login data into .netrc file. 
```
machine <site> login <mail/username> password <password>
i.e: 
machine vk login tai@babi.com password tai@kuda
machine facebook login tai@babi.com password tai@kuda
```
> `Important:` **Because personal data login is a very confidential thing, i exclude my .netrc file in gitignore. if you want add, remove netrc in gitignore and  make you repo private before you push .netrc file**
